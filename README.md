# Darwin

Darwin is a flexible framework for programming genetic algorithms, aimed at research applications. It is representation
agnostic, working just as well for simple GA examples as it does for complex genetic programming problems. It can be
configured to perform both single- and multi-objective optimisation, including the SPEA2 algorithm. It has facility for
adaptive evolution where the run parameters evolve in response to changes in the population.

## Usage

Add it to your project.clj file:
````
[darwin "1.0.0"]
````

A simple usage example can be found in the ws/demo.clj, viewable
[here](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=JonyEpsilon&repo=darwin&path=ws/demo.clj).
